## 🧠 What is SoulEyez?

**SoulEyez is an AI-powered penetration testing platform that replaces chaotic terminal workflows with one organized command center.**

Instead of juggling dozens of terminal windows, notes, and output files, SoulEyez gives you a **single, structured environment** to:

- Run and chain security tools
- Track findings, credentials, and evidence
- Auto-discover next attack paths
- Generate professional reports
- Validate detections against SIEM platforms

> ⚠️ **Authorization Required**  
> SoulEyez must only be used on systems you own or have **explicit written permission** to test. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation is illegal.
